# Magnify Automated Build and Commit  

This package is designed to automate the process of building a production React app and pushing it to GitHub  
To use this package:  
- Clone repo  
- Change directory to repo dir  
- In terminal run "npm i -g"  
- In root Magnify repo you can now run command "deploy build -c || --client {client_folder} -m || --message {message_for_git_commit}"  
  - client_folder is the subfolder name of each client in the clients folder  
  - message_for_git_commit is whatever message you will be providing to git for the build  


Good luck and happy coding!
